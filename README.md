A fast, native, keyboard-first modern browser that thinks with you. Built on WebKit for speed and efficiency, enhanced with AI for smarter browsing.

![Flakes Browser](demo.gif)

**Spoiler: Not a typical browser.** Flakes has no toolbar, no address bar, and minimal chrome. Everything is accessed via keyboard shortcuts and the command palette (⌘K). If you rely on clicking buttons to navigate, this browser is not for you. Built for hackers, writers, and power users who live in their keyboards.

## Why Flakes?

**Fast & Native**
- Cold start < 500ms(with 10 tabs restore), tab switching < 50ms
- Built on WebKit - lightweight, efficient, zero bloat
- Native macOS integration with Apple Silicon optimization

**Smart & Thoughtful**
- AI understands your pages, not just your queries
- Keyboard-first design - Vim-style navigation everywhere
- Extends your focus, never interrupts it
- Privacy-first with built-in ad & tracker blocking
- AI features can be disabled for full control
- Distraction-free interface

## What Works Today

- Sandboxed per macOS app security model

## The Vision

> **"A browser designed for thinking, not scrolling."**

**Speed is Philosophy**. Every interaction must feel instant. Native performance isn't a feature - it's the foundation everything else builds on.

**Intelligence, Not Interruption**. AI should augment your thinking without demanding attention - we are learning to work with AI, not for it to work for us.

**Beyond Tabs & URLs**. The web should be more human. We're building toward intent-driven browsing where you express goals, not addresses.
